Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Shannay Rawal, a PhD student in environmental engineering on a mission to uncover innovative ways to make our world more sustainable. Whether it's transforming waste into valuable resources, optimizing energy systems, or decoding insights from environmental data, I thrive at the intersection of technology, policy-making, and problem-solving. Think of this site as my digital lab notebookâ€”minus the coffee stains and zoned-out doodles!
