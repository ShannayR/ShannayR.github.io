  title = {Metamodel-based parametric study of composite laminates},
  journal = {IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering},
  abstract = {Composite laminates are an integral part of structural engineering. To exploit the full potential of such laminated structures, it is important to understand the effect of various material and geometric parameters on its static and dynamic behaviour. Conventionally high-fidelity numerical procedures like finite element methods have been used to carry out such analysis. Despite their overwhelming accuracy, such methods are computational time intensive making them unsuitable to carry out exhaustive parametric studies. To counter this, a polynomial regression-based metamodeling strategy and its subsequent use as a quick parametric analysis tool is depicted in this study. The metamodels are meticulously built and rigorously validated on the training and testing data using suitable statistical measures like \( R^2 \), \( R^2_{adj} \), and \( Q^2_{F3} \).},

  title = {Effect of fire retardancy materials in fibre reinforced composite plate for false ceilings: A Review},
  journal = {IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering},
  abstract = {The use of fillers in composite material development and manufacturing has been in commercial use for decades. These fillers induce and/or enhance desirable characteristics in the composite matrix. Flammability is a major deterrent contributing to the reduced scope of utility of completely biodegradable composites. The ability of any material to act as a flame retardant is influenced not only by explicit factors such as the material’s melting temperature and thermal degradation factor, but also by various implicit factors such as the multiple transformations taking place in the material and the compounds that are generated due to the material’s exposure to elevated temperatures. The paper studies and compares the mechanism of fire retardancy of four popular fillers and aims to determine their effectiveness in introducing fire retardancy in biodegradable false ceiling materials. The results show that the properties of fire retardancy can be measured in terms of heat release rates, limiting oxygen indexes, and thermogravimetric analyses. Final comments are on the testing standards used to check fire retardancy.},

  title = {A review on straightening of bars and application of probabilistic approach on Moment-curvature relationship},
  journal = {IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering},
  abstract = {Bar straightening is a significant process in the value stream of bar manufacturing processes. Any improvement in the process has a substantial impact on quality and productivity as a whole. This paper presents the outline of the fundamentals of the straightening process from a material science perspective and discusses the state of the art in terms of process analysis and development. It has been inferred that the major aspect of the process is to understand the moment-curvature relationship in bars subjected to re-rolling. The process is governed by several parameters such as bar speed, the angle between osculating plane and loading plane, bar size or radius of bar, applied reverse bending moment, initial and final curvature, etc. It has also been observed that the research in this domain has seldom applied a statistical approach to enhance process capability. A brief account of the potential use of statistical process control has been presented. The use of statistics shall enable a better understanding of various process parameters, which in turn will help in deciding whether the process is in control and assist in deciding the acceptance or rejection of a lot.},

  title = {Demand side climate change mitigation actions and SDGs: literature review with systematic evidence search},
  journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
  abstract = {This study undertakes a review of the literature between 2015 and 2020 with systematic evidence searching and screening. The literature search has been conducted in the Scopus Database. From over 6887 literature in the initial search, 294 relevant literature were finally reviewed to link demand-side interventions of avoid-shift-improve (ASI) categories to SDGs. Results show that a wide range of improvement actions are already helping in incremental steps to reduce demand and emissions in various services like mobility, shelter, and industrial products. However, ASI categories provide more distinct mitigation actions. Positive links of these actions to multiple SDGs are overall very strong; however, a few trade-offs have been observed.},
