I completed two CITI Program courses to obtain certifications on research practices in human subject research. 

## Course Overview

The courses focused on essential aspects of responsible research conduct, covering:
<ol>
  <li>Responsible Conduct of Research for Engineers</li>
  <li>Biomedical Responsible Conduct of Research</li>
  <li>Social and Behavioral Responsible Conduct of Research</li>
</ol>


###Biomedical Research Investigators: Human Subject Research
This course provided training in ethical considerations and regulations governing biomedical research. Key areas of focus included:
<ol>
  <li>Principles of the Belmont Report.</li>
  <li>Informed consent processes.</li>
  <li>HIPAA privacy protections for research data.</li>
  <li>Procedures for addressing unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects.</li>
</ol>

###Social & Behavioral Research Investigators: Human Subject Research
This course emphasized ethical practices in social and behavioral research, covering:
<ol>
  <li>Privacy and confidentiality protections for human subjects.</li>
  <li>Assessing risks and applying safeguards in research design.</li>
  <li>Federal regulations and ethical principles from the Belmont Report.</li>
  <li>Strategies for conducting research with vulnerable populations.</li>
</ol>

## Key Learning Objectives

<ol>
  <li>Gained a thorough understanding of ethical frameworks, including the Belmont Report, and their application to human subject research.</li>
  <li>Developed skills for ensuring privacy, confidentiality, and data security in compliance with federal regulations.</li>
