Welcome back to *Bears, Beets, Breaking News #2* —your favorite sporadic newsletter, as unpredictable as a Dunder Mifflin staff meeting. Today, we're diving into a topic more complex than Michael Scott's management style: **Doughnut Economics**.

## Doughnut Economics: A Framework for Sustainable Development

Doughnut Economics, introduced by [Kate Raworth](https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/) in 2012 <d-cite key="raworth2012"></d-cite>, is a novel approach to economic thinking that balances human needs with planetary boundaries. This model, visually represented as a Doughnut, consists of two concentric rings:

- **Inner Ring**: The social foundation, encompassing essential human needs such as health, education, and gender equality.
- **Outer Ring**: The ecological ceiling, based on the planetary boundaries framework developed by the Stockholm Resilience Centre. This identifies nine critical Earth system processes that maintain planetary stability and resilience.

### The Safe and Just Space for Humanity

Between these two rings lies the "safe and just space for humanity," where human needs are met without overshooting Earth's ecological limits. Unlike traditional economic models that prioritize unlimited growth, Doughnut Economics advocates for creating **regenerative and distributive economies** that thrive within planetary boundaries.

This framework has gained traction internationally, influencing discussions across education, communities, businesses, and governments. Its holistic approach offers a promising path toward achieving sustainable development while respecting social and ecological boundaries.

## The Doughnut's Secret Recipe: Three Pillars of Sustainability 

The three pillars of sustainability—**environmental, social, and economic**—are baked right into the Doughnut Economics model. The goal is to find balance and create systems that work harmoniously across these interconnected domains.

That's all for now, folks! Remember, in the words of the great philosopher Michael Scott, *"I'm not superstitious, but I am a little stitious."*
