Hey there, fellow Proles!

Welcome to the fourth edition of *Bears, Beets, Breaking News*â€”where we dive into topics more complex than Creed's tax returns and more fascinating than Kevin's understanding of numbers. Today, we're taking a break from the daily Prolefeed to explore the philosophical underpinnings of environmental engineering research.

## The Research Hierarchy: From Ontology to Methods in Environmental Engineering

As an environmental engineer engaged in stakeholder-based research, I've observed how the philosophical underpinnings of our work shape our approach to solving complex environmental challenges. The research hierarchy, consisting of ontology, epistemology, methodology, and methods, provides a framework for understanding these philosophical foundations and their practical applications. This edition of the newsletter attempts to map how these elements differ between quantitative and qualitative research approaches in environmental engineering.

### Ontology: The Nature of Reality

At the top of the research hierarchy sits ontology, which deals with the nature of reality and what can be known about it (<i>[Linking Ontology, Epistemology and Research Methodology](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3708935)</i>). We often adopt a realist ontology in quantitative environmental research, assuming that an objective reality exists independently of our perceptions. This might manifest in studies measuring pollutant concentrations or modeling climate change impacts. Qualitative research performed by engineers (and others without a background in social science) tends to lean towards a constructivist ontology, recognizing that stakeholders' perceptions and social constructs play a crucial role in environmental issues. This could be attributed to experiences with NIMBY protests and construction delays. When studying community responses to proposed infrastructure projects, engineers quickly acknowledge that multiple realities coexist based on diverse stakeholder perspectives (<i>[Alternative Ways of Seeking Knowledge in Consumer Research](https://doi.org/10.1086/209132)</i>).

### Epistemology: The Nature of Knowledge

Epistemology concerns how we acquire knowledge and the relationship between the researcher and the subject of study (<i>[An invitation to qualitative research](https://us.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/34087_Chapter1.pdf)</i>). Quantitative environmental research commonly aligns with a positivist epistemology, emphasizing objective measurements and the researcher's detachment from the subject. This approach is more evident in studies without a strong human connection to the data, like research that relies on sensor data or statistical analyses of environmental trends. On the other hand, qualitative research in our field often adopts an interpretivist epistemology, recognizing the researcher's role in interpreting stakeholder views and experiences. This is particularly relevant when conducting interviews or focus groups to understand community perceptions of environmental risks.


### Methodology: The Strategy for Knowledge Creation

Methodology bridges our philosophical stance with practical research methods (<i>[An invitation to qualitative research](https://us.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/34087_Chapter1.pdf)</i>). In quantitative environmental engineering research, we often employ experimental or survey methodologies created to test hypotheses and establish causal relationships. For example, we might use controlled experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of new water treatment technologies. Qualitative methodologies in our field, such as case studies or participatory action research, aim to explore complex social-ecological systems in depth. These approaches are particularly valuable when investigating stakeholder dynamics in environmental decision-making processes (<i>[Five pillars for stakeholder analyses in sustainability transformations: The global case of phosphorus](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2020.02.019)</i>).

### Methods: The Tools for Data Collection and Analysis

The specific methods we use to collect and analyze data are at the base of the hierarchy. Quantitative methods in environmental engineering typically involve structured data collection techniques like surveys, measurements, or remote sensing, followed by statistical analysis. For instance, we might use air quality monitors to collect data and then apply regression analysis to identify pollution trends. On the other hand, qualitative methods often include semi-structured interviews, focus groups, or participant observation, with data analyzed through techniques like thematic analysis or grounded theory. These methods are particularly useful when exploring stakeholders' values, beliefs, and experiences related to environmental issues (<i>[The Three Logics of Qualitative Research: Epistemology, Ontology, and Methodology in Political Science](https://doi.org/10.29333/ajqr/14083)</i>).

### Integrating Approaches in Stakeholder-Based Research

Environmental engineering projects have the potential to benefit from combining quantitative and qualitative approaches. This allows us to combine the strengths of objective measurements with rich, contextual insights from stakeholders. For example, when assessing the impacts of a proposed dam, we might use quantitative methods to model hydrological changes and qualitative methods to understand community perceptions and concerns (<i>[Stakeholder Analysis in Environmental and Conservation Planning](https://www.amnh.org/content/download/158575/2593966/file/stakeholder-analysis-in-environmental-and-conservation-planning.pdf)</i>).

More comprehensive and effective stakeholder-based environmental engineering studies can be designed by acknowledging progressive differences in the research hierarchy and their manifestation in quantitative and qualitative approaches. Adopting this approach enables us to address complex environmental challenges while considering the technical and social dimensions of sustainability.
