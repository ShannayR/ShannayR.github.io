Today, we’re diving into a topic more complex than Michael Scott’s management style: <strong>Doughnut Economics</strong>.</p> <h2 id="doughnut-economics-a-framework-for-sustainable-development">Doughnut Economics: A Framework for Sustainable Development</h2> <p>Doughnut Economics, introduced by <a href="https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/">Kate Raworth</a> in 2012 <d-cite key="raworth2012"></d-cite>, is a novel approach to economic thinking that balances human needs with planetary boundaries. This model, visually represented as a Doughnut, consists of two concentric rings:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Inner Ring</strong>: The social foundation, encompassing essential human needs such as health, education, and gender equality.</li> <li><strong>Outer Ring</strong>: The ecological ceiling, based on the planetary boundaries framework developed by the Stockholm Resilience Centre. This identifies nine critical Earth system processes that maintain planetary stability and resilience.</li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Doughnut-Economics1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Doughnut-Economics1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Doughnut-Economics1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/Doughnut-Economics1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Shortfalls and overshoot in the Doughnut <d-cite key="Raworth2017"></d-cite> <em>Source: The Lancet Planetary Health</em></p> <h3 id="the-safe-and-just-space-for-humanity">The Safe and Just Space for Humanity</h3> <p>Between these two rings lies the “safe and just space for humanity,” where human needs are met without overshooting Earth’s ecological limits. Unlike traditional economic models that prioritize unlimited growth, Doughnut Economics advocates for creating <strong>regenerative and distributive economies</strong> that thrive within planetary boundaries.</p> <h3 id="seven-ways-to-think-like-a-21st-century-economist">Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist</h3> <p>Doughnut Economics proposes seven key principles to guide modern economic thinking:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Doughnut-Economics2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Doughnut-Economics2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Doughnut-Economics2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/Doughnut-Economics2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p><a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/transformation/seven-ways-to-think-like-21st-century-economist/">Seven ways to think like a 21st-century economist</a> <em>Source: Doughnut Economics Action Lab</em><d-cite key="RaworthBook"></d-cite></p> <p>This framework has gained traction internationally, influencing discussions across education, communities, businesses, and governments. Its holistic approach offers a promising path toward achieving sustainable development while respecting social and ecological boundaries.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-doughnuts-secret-recipe-three-pillars-of-sustainability">The Doughnut’s Secret Recipe: Three Pillars of Sustainability</h2> <p>The three pillars of sustainability—<strong>environmental, social, and economic</strong>—are baked right into the Doughnut Economics model. The goal is to find balance and create systems that work harmoniously across these interconnected domains.</p> <hr/> <p>That’s all for now, folks! Remember, in the words of the great philosopher Michael Scott, <em>“I’m not superstitious, but I am a little stitious.”</em></p> <p>For more information on Doughnut Economics, visit <a href="https://doughnuteconomics.org/about-doughnut-economics">Doughnut Economics Action Lab</a>.
